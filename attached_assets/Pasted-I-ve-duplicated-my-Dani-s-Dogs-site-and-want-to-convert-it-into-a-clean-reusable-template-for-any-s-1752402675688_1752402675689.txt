I’ve duplicated my Dani’s Dogs site and want to convert it into a clean, reusable template for any service-based pet business (e.g. groomers, dog walkers, trainers).

Use the existing layout but apply the following changes:

---

🔧 STRUCTURE & DESIGN UPDATES

1. Remove all Dani’s Dogs-specific text, branding, and pink tones.
2. Update the colour palette to:
   - Soft cream or white background
   - Light greys and muted pastels (avoid heavy pinks)
   - Clean black or dark grey text for readability
3. Tidy up spacing:
   - Consistent padding between all sections
   - Mobile-friendly formatting (especially hero section and footer)
4. Add subtle soft-circle background styling (like Leonardo AI-style) in black/grey/white tones behind key sections.

📋 CONTENT & COPY CHANGES

1. **Hero Section**
   - Heading: `Your Pet Business – Premium [Service]`
   - Subheading: `Lovingly caring for your pets in [Location]`
   - CTA button: `Book Now` or `Get a Free Quote`
   - Optional secondary CTA: `See Prices`

2. **Benefits Section**
   - “Stress-free grooming experience” 🪶  
   - “Natural, pet-safe products” 🧼  
   - “Flexible, walk-in appointments” ⏰  
   - Include simple icons and keep layout clean

3. **Services Snapshot**
   - 3–4 core services, short and punchy descriptions
   - Same visual style as existing Dani’s Dogs layout

4. **About Section**
   - Generic bio: “We’re passionate pet lovers offering top-quality care and friendly service for every furry client.”

5. **Gallery / My Work**
   - Keep layout from Dani’s Dogs
   - Keep image containers and lightbox if present

6. **Contact Section**
   - Leave layout as-is, update to generic contact details for demo use

7. **Footer**
   - Add line: `Demo site by Paws & Pixels – Customisable for your pet business`
   - Ensure footer has minimal spacing (as you already tweaked)

---

💡 Final task:
- Clean up unused files and CSS
- Add clear comments above each major section for easy editing in future

End goal: A polished, ready-to-clone service-based template that can be repurposed in minutes with new text, branding, and images.
