# Pet Business Website Template

## Overview

This is a professional, reusable website template designed for pet service businesses (groomers, dog walkers, trainers, etc.). The template was created by transforming a specific pet grooming business site into a generic, customizable template. It features a modern, responsive design with a warm and welcoming aesthetic suitable for any pet care service.

### Key Design Decisions
- **Static Site**: Chosen for simplicity, fast loading times, and cost-effective hosting
